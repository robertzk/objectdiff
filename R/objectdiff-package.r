#' Objectdiff is an R package for measuring differences
#' between arbitrary R objects using patches, a la Git. For example,
#' if you have slightly modified a data.frame, and you would like to
#' record the change, it would be more efficient to only record what 
#' is different, rather than a full copy of both data sets.
