Type: Package
Title: Objectdiff
Version: 0.2.0
Description: Objectdiff is an R package for measuring differences
    between arbitrary R objects using patches, a la Git. For example,
    if you have slightly modified a data.frame, and you would like to
    record the change, it would be more efficient to only record what
    is different, rather than a full copy of both data sets.
